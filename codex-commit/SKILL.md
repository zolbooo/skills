- Use semantic commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`.
- Keep commits focused and describe the “why” when non-obvious.
- Add the `Co-authored-by: chatgpt-codex-connector[bot] <199175422+chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>` header in the commit for transparency
